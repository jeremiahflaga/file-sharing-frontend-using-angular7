# Simple File Sharing App - frontend, using Angular 7

**NOTE:** Because I'm not yet good when it comes to Authentication and Authorization part of a software system, I used an existing codebase to get me started with this project: I used the "Angular 7 - User Registration and Login" template, located in https://github.com/cornflourblue/angular-7-registration-login-example-cli, created by Jason Watmore.
